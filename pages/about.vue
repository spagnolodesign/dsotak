      <p class="italic"><sup>“ </sup><boldy>We travel</boldy>, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed.” <br/>― Pico Lyer </p>
      <p>Through and through, the joys of travel have been felt by generations.<br>
      What comes with the opportunity to experience the true beauty of a different place is a responsibility as a traveller.<br>
      The reality of profit being a driving force throughout the world is that it changes the way governments take care of their people, environment, and industry & labor laws.<br>
      It’s a fact that the travel industry does drive profit - but being the traveller, you get to choose which ethical values you admire and want to drive forward.<br>
      </p>
      <p><boldy>Luckily for you</boldy>, I make following that path easier than it sounds.</p>
